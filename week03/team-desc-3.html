        The <code>overflow</code> property clips the content within an element based on the current
        dimensions, adding optional behavior such as scrolling.
        <br /><br />

        According to the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/overflow">MDN
        documentation</a>, the following possible configurations are possible:
        <div class="code-block">
          &rsaquo; visible<br />
          &rsaquo; hidden<br />
          &rsaquo; scroll<br />
          &rsaquo; auto<br />
          &rsaquo; hidden<br />
          &rsaquo; visible<br />
        </div> <!-- code-block -->

        In the following example, the browser will automatically clip the text in any
        <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> element, which in most cases will cause vertical scrolling:
        <div class="code-block">
          div {<br />
          &nbsp;&nbsp;overflow: auto;<br />
          }<br />
        </div> <!-- code-block -->

        This is demonstrated below:
        <div class="demo-block">
          <div style="
            margin: 10px auto 10px 100px;
            padding: 20px;
            max-width: 400px;
            max-height: 100px;
            overflow: auto;
            background-color: #bbf;">
              Did you ever hear the tragedy of Darth Plagueis The Wise?
              I thought not. It’s not a story the Jedi would tell you. It’s a Sith legend.
              Darth Plagueis was a Dark Lord of the Sith, so powerful and so wise he could
              use the Force to influence the midichlorians to create life…
              He had such a knowledge of the dark side that he could even keep the ones he
              cared about from dying. The dark side of the Force is a pathway to many abilities
              some consider to be unnatural. He became so powerful… the only thing he was afraid of
              was losing his power, which eventually, of course, he did. Unfortunately, he taught his
              apprentice everything he knew, then his apprentice killed him in his sleep. Ironic.
              He could save others from death, but not himself.<br /><br />
