        <div class="sub-container-wide text-left justify-center">
          <strong>Subject</strong>: Home Link Icon
          <br /><br />
          <strong>Guideline</strong>:

          </a>
          <br /><br />
          <strong>Rationale</strong>:
          I chose to include a home link icon in my page since it's advised that such a link be present
          in each page of a site. Virtually all major sites have this, including Google, Apple, Microsoft,
          Facebook, Twitter, Reddit, Instagram, etc. The existence of this icon/logo helps the user know how
          to get back to the homepage (which, in this case, is
          <a href="../index.html" class="link-normal">Assignments</a>). True, I also have an "Assignments" link
          button up in the header, but this makes it more obvious how to get to the root page.
          <br />

        <div class="sub-container-wide text-left justify-center">
          <strong>Subject</strong>: Colors
          <br /><br />
          <strong>Guideline</strong>:
          <a href="https://webstyleguide.com/wsg3/7-page-design/3-visual-design.html" class="link-normal">
            Web Style Guide v3 | Page Design: Visual Design
          </a>
          <br /><br />
          <strong>Rationale</strong>:
          The color schemes of the <a href="../index.html" class="link-normal">Assignments</a> page as well as
          the <a href="../week03/index.html" class="link-normal">Old Commerical Site</a> page are distracting
          at best and horrendous at worst. I figured, this time, to simplify the colors by removing hue and
          saturation out of virtually everything (except for some links and the company logo). This helps the
          user feel more comfortable reading the page as there are almost no distracting color combinations.
          <br />
          Frankly, I would add more color in at a future date, but this was the route I chose to go for this
          week due to time constraints.

        <div class="sub-container-wide text-left justify-center">
          <strong>Subject</strong>: Header Navbar
          <br /><br />
          <strong>Guideline</strong>:
          <a href="https://webstyleguide.com/wsg3/6-page-structure/3-site-design.html" class="link-normal">
            Web Style Guide v3 | Page Structure: Site Design
          </a>
          <br /><br />
          <strong>Rationale</strong>:
          I chose to include a pinned header with links at the top of each page of this week's sub-site in order
          to give the user a way to quickly find the links to each site's page. I modeled the concept from Apple's
          website, though on their site the header navigation bar is simply at the top of the page, not pinned.
          I decided to pin my navigation bar simply out of personal taste and to give the page an extra scrolling
          feature.
          <br />
          Note that I did not include breadcrumbs like in past weeks. I decided not to this time
          since all of the necessary links are present in the navigation bar.
          <br />
          Note also that, of course, some pages on this site would still need to be created (namely, "API" and
          "Register"), so those links are defunct.
          <br />

        <div class="sub-container-wide text-left justify-center">
          <strong>Subject</strong>: Simplicity
          <br /><br />
          <strong>Guideline</strong>:
          <a href="https://webstyleguide.com/wsg3/4-interface-design/3-interface-design.html" class="link-normal">
            Web Style Guide v3 | Interface Design
          </a>
          <br /><br />
          <strong>Rationale</strong>:
          Along the same logic behind the color scheme, I chose to simplify my page design in order to remove
          the unimpressive, distracting elements. True, I do not feel I had very many unnecessary elements in
          past weeks, but I did choose to remove things such as round borders in order to present the page in
          a clear, somewhat more professional way.
          <br />
          That being said, I kept the box-shadows for the divisions as well as added some color transition effects
          to the link buttons so as to avoid leaving the site <em>too</em> boring.

          <strong>Subject</strong>: Footer

          </a>
          <br /><br />
          <strong>Rationale</strong>:
          I added a footer with some helpful information, including my name and licensing terms. Virtually all
          major websites have some sort of footer which is necessary for authoring, licensing and copyright
          reasons. I especially want all users to know that this site is undoubtedly a test site and is in no
          way intended to be a real business. I did not want this information anywhere else since it's only
          useful to a select few, so the footer was the best spot to put it.
